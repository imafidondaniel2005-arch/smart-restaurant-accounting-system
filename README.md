Smart Restaurant Accounting System
Project Overview

The Smart Restaurant Accounting System is a MATLAB-based financial management tool developed to help restaurants efficiently record daily sales, calculate revenue, and analyze financial performance.

This system automates basic accounting tasks and reduces manual calculation errors by using structured data processing and mathematical operations in MATLAB.

Objectives

Record daily restaurant sales data

Automate revenue calculations

Compute total and average sales

Apply percentage-based deductions (e.g., expenses or background costs)

Generate structured financial summaries

Technologies Used

MATLAB

MATLAB Live Script (.mlx)

Basic mathematical modeling

Vector operations

Element-wise operations (.*)

Built-in functions such as sum() and mean()

Core Features

Daily sales input system

Automated revenue computation

Expense percentage calculation

Weekly total revenue calculation

Average daily sales computation

Organized financial output display

How It Works

Sales data is stored in a vector.

Percentage-based operational costs are applied using element-wise multiplication.

Total revenue is calculated using sum().

Average revenue is computed using mean().

Results are displayed in a structured format.

Possible Improvements

Graphical visualization of sales trends

Monthly and yearly analysis

Inventory tracking integration

User interface (GUI) implementation

Database integration for real-time storage
